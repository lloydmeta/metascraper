# Metascraper [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lloydmeta/metascraper.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lloydmeta/metascraper)

A Scala library built on Akka actors and [jsoup](http://jsoup.org/) that allows you to retrieve meta data from pages at specified URLs, prioritising [Open Graph tags](http://ogp.me/) over traditional tags if they exist.

Tested against Scala 2.10.x, OpenJDK 6 and 7, and Oracle JDK 7.

## Installation

Add the following to your `build.sbt`

```scala
libraryDependencies += "com.beachape.metascraper" %% "metascraper" % "0.1.6"
```

If the above does not work because it cannot be resolved, its likely because it hasn't been synced to Maven central yet.
In that case, download a SNAPSHOT release of the same version by adding this to `build.sbt`

```
resolvers += "Sonatype OSS Snapshots" at "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots"

libraryDependencies += "com.beachape.metascraper" %% "metascraper" % "0.1.6-SNAPSHOT"
```

## Example usage
```scala
import akka.actor.ActorSystem
import com.beachape.metascraper.Messages._
import com.beachape.metascraper.ScraperActor
import scala.concurrent.Await
import akka.pattern.ask
import akka.util.Timeout
import scala.concurrent.duration._

implicit val timeout = Timeout(30 seconds)

implicit val system = ActorSystem("actorSystem")
implicit val dispatcher = system.dispatcher

val scraperActor = system.actorOf(ScraperActor())

for {
  future <- ask(scraperActor, ScrapeUrl("https://bbc.co.uk")).mapTo[Either[FailedToScrapeUrl,ScrapedData]]
} {
  future match {
    case Left(throwable) => {
      println("Failed: ")
      println(throwable.getMessage)
    }
    case Right(data) => {
      println("Image urls")
      data.imageUrls.foreach(println)
    }
  }
}

```

## Example application

[Metascraper-service](https://github.com/lloydmeta/metascraper-service): a RESTful Play2 service that uses this library to scrape data from a requested URL, taking advantage of the tight integration that Play2 has with Akka.
