# Metascraper [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lloydmeta/metascraper.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lloydmeta/metascraper) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/lloydmeta/metascraper/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/r/lloydmeta/metascraper?branch=master) [![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/com.beachape.metascraper/metascraper_2.11/badge.svg)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/com.beachape.metascraper/metascraper_2.11)

A non-blocking Scala library that allows you to retrieve meta data from various URLs.

Out of the box, supports HTML content (works with OpenGraph as well as normal HTML meta/image tags), but can be easily extended to
support any kind of content (just implement `Schema` and `SchemaFactory`) so that you can work with any URL that returns an Array of Bytes.

Tested against Scala 2.10.x, 2.11.x, and 2.12.x.

## Installation

Add the following to your `build.sbt`

```scala
libraryDependencies += "com.beachape.metascraper" %% "metascraper" % version
```

If the above does not work because it cannot be resolved, its likely because it hasn't been synced to Maven central yet.
In that case, download a SNAPSHOT release of the same version by adding this to `build.sbt`

```scala
resolvers += "Sonatype OSS Snapshots" at "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots"

libraryDependencies += "com.beachape.metascraper" %% "metascraper" % s"$version-SNAPSHOT"
```

## Example usage

### Scraper

```Scala
// You can customise Http here (it is simply Dispatcher's Http client)
val scraper = new Scraper(Http, Seq("http", "https"))

val fData: Future[ScrapedData] = scraper.fetch(ScrapeUrl("https://google.com"))

```

### ScraperActor

If you prefer to use a Scraper actor (e.g. to distribute load to remote systems), use ScraperActor:

```scala
import akka.actor.ActorSystem
import com.beachape.metascraper.Messages._
import com.beachape.metascraper.ScraperActor
import scala.concurrent.Await
import akka.pattern.ask
import akka.util.Timeout
import scala.concurrent.duration._

implicit val timeout = Timeout(30 seconds)

implicit val system = ActorSystem("actorSystem")
implicit val dispatcher = system.dispatcher

val scraperActor = system.actorOf(ScraperActor())

for {
  future <- ask(scraperActor, ScrapeUrl("https://bbc.co.uk")).mapTo[Either[Throwable,ScrapedData]]
} {
  future match {
    case Left(throwable) => {
      println("Failed: ")
      println(throwable.getMessage)
    }
    case Right(data) => {
      println("Image urls")
      data.imageUrls.foreach(println)
    }
  }
}

### Custom scraping schema

You can customise scraping by implementing `SchemaFactory` and `Schema`.

- A `SchemaFactory` needs to implement a method that takes a `Response` from AsyncHttpClient and returns a list of `Schema`
- A `Schema` is what is used to extract data from the response

This allows you to freely customise the way this lib extracts data from HTTP endpoints, for example as listed on [Schema.org](https://schema.org/).

That said, if all you want to do is implement a custom HTML data scraper, you just need to implement `HtmlSchema`
and pass it along to a `ScrapeUrl` message inside `HtmlSchemas`, as follows:

```scala

case class CustomHtmlSchema(doc: Document) extends HtmlSchema {
 // Implementations
}

val scraper = new Scraper(httpClient = Http, urlSchemas = Seq("http", "https"))
val scrapeMessage = ScrapeUrl("https://google.com", schemaFactories = Seq(HtmlSchemas(OpenGraph, CustomHtmlSchema, NormalPage)) )
val fData = scraper.fetch(scrapeMessage)
```

In the above case, `HtmlSchemas` is a `SchemaFactory` that creates a Jsoup `Document` and gives it to the `Schema`s that
it generates. That way, only one String to Document parse needs to happen.


## Example applications

1. [Metascraper-service](https://github.com/lloydmeta/metascraper-service): a RESTful Play2 service that uses this library to scrape data from a requested URL, taking advantage of the tight integration that Play2 has with Akka.

2. [Metascraper-scalatra](https://github.com/lloydmeta/metascraper-scalatra): same as 1. but built on Scalatra, which is more light-weight and Servlet 3.0 compliant.
